      </h3>
      <h4 className='home-content-title'>What Size is the Van?</h4>
      <div className='home-content-general-info'>
        <p>
        We usually use a luton van for local work. This is the most common one used for removals in the UK. 
        Its box has a capacity of 15 m3 and it is ideal for the transport of many boxes and large furniture.

      <div className='home-content-general-info'>
        <p>
        Sometimes you may need a couple of guys to move something at the last minute. 
        The best way to arrange that would be to contact Tom at 07909126369. 
        He will try to satisfy your requests as soon as possible.
